# GitHub Stats Web Service - A Portfolio Project

![Project Banner](link-to-image)  
_A real-time GitHub statistics tracker that helps developers, recruiters, and enthusiasts easily access key GitHub profile metrics._

## üìñ **Story Behind the Project**

As a software engineer, I‚Äôve always relied heavily on GitHub for version control, collaboration, and portfolio sharing. One day, during a recruitment drive for a dev team, I had to manually review multiple GitHub profiles to assess candidates' contributions and activity levels. This manual process quickly became overwhelming, and I realized how cumbersome it was to extract meaningful insights without a dedicated tool.

The idea for the **GitHub Stats Web Service** emerged from this personal frustration. I wanted to build a service that would simplify tracking GitHub profiles, making it easier for developers and recruiters alike to monitor repositories, follower counts, contributions, and more‚Äîall in real-time.

With this project, I sought to transform an everyday pain point into an efficient, user-friendly solution. Below, I‚Äôll walk you through the technical details, challenges, and solutions I encountered during development.

## üí° **Project Overview**

The GitHub Stats Web Service allows users to input a GitHub username and instantly retrieve relevant statistics such as:
- **Repository Count**
- **Follower Count**
- **Public Contributions**
- **Popular Repositories**

Users are presented with these stats in a clean, interactive dashboard, allowing for quick and meaningful insights into a GitHub profile.

## üõ† **Tech Stack**

This project was built using a combination of the following technologies:

### **Backend**
- **Node.js & Express:** Chosen for its lightweight and performant nature. Express.js is used to create the API responsible for fetching data from GitHub‚Äôs API.
- **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to GitHub‚Äôs API and handling responses.
- **Redis:** Implemented as a caching layer to reduce API call frequency and improve response times. Redis is crucial for bypassing GitHub‚Äôs strict API rate limits.

### **Frontend**
- **React.js:** Used to build the user interface. React‚Äôs component-based structure allows us to create a dynamic and reusable dashboard.
- **Material-UI:** For styling and UI elements. Material-UI provides a modern, clean look for our dashboard.
- **Chart.js:** Integrated to create visual representations of GitHub data, such as contribution graphs and repository statistics.

### **Deployment**
- **Heroku/Vercel:** Used for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring that changes made to the code are deployed swiftly and without downtime.

## üåç **Data Flow Architecture**

Here‚Äôs a high-level overview of how data flows through the system:

![Architecture Diagram](link-to-architecture-diagram)

1. **User Interaction**: A user inputs a GitHub username into the frontend.
2. **API Call**: The frontend sends a request to the backend to fetch data from the GitHub API.
3. **Redis Caching**: Before making a request to GitHub‚Äôs API, the backend checks Redis for cached data. If the data exists, it is retrieved and sent back to the frontend. If not, a request is made to GitHub.
4. **Data Fetching**: GitHub‚Äôs API returns the requested data.
5. **Store and Cache**: The backend stores the data in Redis for future requests and sends it to the frontend.
6. **Display**: The frontend updates the UI with the retrieved statistics and displays them in charts and tables.

## ‚ú® **Key Features**

1. **Real-Time GitHub Stats Fetching**
   - The app allows users to search for any GitHub username and retrieve stats like repositories, followers, and contributions in real time. This feature is ideal for recruiters who want a quick snapshot of a developer's activity.
  
2. **Caching with Redis**
   - To handle GitHub API rate limits, I implemented Redis to cache data from previous API requests. This ensures that frequently requested profiles return faster and reduce the likelihood of hitting rate limits.
  
3. **Interactive Dashboard**
   - Using React.js and Chart.js, the stats are presented in an easy-to-digest format. Contribution trends are shown as graphs, and key metrics like followers and repository count are highlighted in clean, readable cards.

## üíª **Technical Challenges & Solutions**

### **Challenge 1: Handling GitHub API Rate Limits**

**Situation**:  
GitHub imposes strict rate limits on API calls, which could hinder our ability to fetch real-time data, especially if users are querying multiple profiles within a short time frame.

**Task**:  
I needed to find a way to efficiently use the GitHub API while minimizing the number of requests made in a given timeframe.

**Action**:  
To tackle this, I integrated **Redis** for caching frequently requested GitHub profiles. Every time a user queries a profile, the system checks the cache for existing data. If the data is cached, it‚Äôs fetched directly from Redis, bypassing the need to call the GitHub API. If not, the request is sent to GitHub‚Äôs API, and the response is then stored in the cache for future use.

**Result**:  
This significantly reduced the number of API calls, improving response times and allowing the service to handle a larger volume of users without hitting rate limits.

### **Challenge 2: Building a Responsive and Scalable Frontend**

**Situation**:  
The frontend needed to display real-time statistics in a visually appealing and responsive manner across various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile).

**Task**:  
Create a flexible, mobile-friendly UI with dynamic charts and tables that adapt to different screen sizes.

**Action**:  
Using **React.js** and **Material-UI**, I built a component-based dashboard that adapts to screen size. I also integrated **Chart.js** to display statistics in the form of visually appealing charts, which automatically adjust their size and format based on the device.

**Result**:  
The app is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience on both mobile and desktop devices. The interactive charts enhance user experience by providing data insights at a glance.

## üìö **What I Learned**

1. **Effective Use of Caching**: Before this project, I had limited experience with caching strategies. Implementing Redis helped me understand the importance of caching in scaling applications and handling API limitations.
2. **Real-Time Data Handling**: This project solidified my knowledge of real-time data fetching and its complexities, particularly with rate-limited APIs.
3. **Frontend Optimization**: I gained deeper insights into building responsive and user-friendly UIs, especially when working with large data sets and visualizations.
4. **The Power of Collaboration**: From design to deployment, I worked closely with fellow developers and mentors, which highlighted the importance of collaboration and feedback in the development process.

## üöÄ **What‚Äôs Next?**

In the next iteration, I plan to:
- **Add OAuth Login**: Allow users to sign in via GitHub OAuth to save and track multiple profiles over time.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Provide more detailed analytics such as the number of issues closed, pull requests merged, and repository stars over time.
- **Improved Performance**: Further optimize the caching mechanism and explore ways to reduce API call latency.
